<h4>What is Bitvest.org?</h4>
<p>
    Bitvest.org is a freelancing site that offers both traditional direct payout and
    share-based payout. Shares can offer dividends, or can be sold in the
    marketplace just like a stock market exchange. The best part, though, is that
    it's completely free and private. Earnings and dividends are paid in Bitcoin,
    and you never have to supply your name or other identification. It's an open,
    private, international free-market digital economy.
</p>
<h4>Why share-based payout?</h4>
<p>
    While direct payout is simpler, higher quality and better work can be often
    be achieved by giving workers a bigger share of the profits based on the
    success of the business. This incentive also helps owners, who may lack
    liquid funds. Investing can be a great way to build an investment portfolio
    for long-term earnings.
